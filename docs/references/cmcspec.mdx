# Cycles Minting Canister (CMC) API

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

## Overview

The Cycles Minting Canister (CMC) is a system canister on the Internet Computer responsible for converting ICP tokens into **cycles**. It supports:

- Topping up existing canisters
- Creating new canisters
- Depositing minted cycles into ledger-managed accounts
- Fetching exchange rates and subnet configuration

The CMC is governed entirely by the **NNS (Network Nervous System)** and receives configuration updates through proposals.

## Configuration Parameters

- **Conversion Rate Source**: The ICP/XDR exchange rate is **pushed** into the CMC by a dedicated *exchange rate canister*. This data reflects live market pricing and determines the ICP→cycles conversion.

- **Governance Control**: All operations of the CMC — including upgrades, configuration, and authorized callers — are managed through NNS proposals.


## API Endpoints
The CMC exposes the following API endpoints for interaction:

## API Endpoints

The CMC exposes a set of core methods for converting ICP into cycles and interacting with subnet configuration. These include:

- `notify_create_canister`: Processes an ICP payment to create a new canister with a designated controller and optional settings.
- `notify_top_up`: Tops up an existing canister with cycles, based on a prior ICP transfer.
- `notify_mint_cycles`: Mints cycles into a cycles ledger account, enabling off-chain or flexible use of cycles.
- `create_canister`: Creates a canister using cycles directly attached to the call.
- `get_icp_xdr_conversion_rate`: Returns the current ICP/XDR exchange rate with certification.
- `get_subnet_types_to_subnets`: Lists available subnets grouped by their types.
- `get_principals_authorized_to_create_canisters_to_subnets`: Indicates which principals are permitted to create canisters on which subnets.
- `get_default_subnets`: Returns the fallback subnets for general-purpose canister creation.
- `get_build_metadata`: Displays internal version and build information for the CMC.
